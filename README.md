# taj_hall
Taj is a site for booking a meeting and lecture hall called Taj. I developed it using Django, and added designs to it using Bootstrap. The site enables you to request a reservation for a specific date for the hall, verifying that there is no reservation on this day, and you will wait for the admin to approve or reject.
